# PerBlue Front-End Developer Code Example

Contents include an entire Unity Project (Version: 2021.3.16f1). Code files can be found at Assets/Code. The Common subfolder contains code I often re-use between projects.

This project aims to port a puzzle game of mine to mobile, as well as providing an in-game level editor that players may use.

A WebGL build for the original project can be played here: https://jwcain.github.io/Hexquisite/ (PC Only)

A WebGL build  for the level building tool and begging mobile port that I will be demoing can be found here: https://jwcain.github.io/PerBlueExample2Build/ (PC Only)

This project includes:
- A Command based level building tool
- A custom text parser/lexer/interpreter generated using ANTLR that can build levels in game.
- Dynamically scaling UI to various screen resolutions, as well as a game camera that adjusts to fit intended content on different resolutions.
  
  
This project does not include:
- A complete re-implementation of the original prototype (yet)
- Mobile Input (time contraints did not allow for this to be implemented as desired)

Assets/Code/LevelBuilder/LevelParser is all autogenerated code by ANTLR and was not authored by me. (However, I did author the .g4 language grammar file located in that folder.)
